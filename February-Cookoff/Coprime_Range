One way is to output a prime number that is greater than RR let us say it XX.

Since XX is a prime number, that means the only factor of XX that is greater than 11 is XX itself. As XX is greater than RR, it wonâ€™t share any common factors greater than 11 with the given range [L, R][L,R].

int32_t main()
{
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
 
  int t;
  cin>>t;
 
  while(t--)
  {
    int l,r;
    cin>>l>>r;
 
    cout<<10000019<<"\n";
  }
 
return 0;
}
